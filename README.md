# music-cards
**music cards** is a project using an nfc reader, a raspberry pi 0, and some nfc cards.
The idea is that you can tap a card on a nfc reader and it will play a playlist acording to the nfc card.

### Where I am so far
Right now I am wiring the nfc reader and a rgb led to the ras pi using a breadboard.
The code it's self just turns a led on and off.
